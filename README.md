# Optimization of the thrust to power consumption ratio of Ion thrusters through simulations
This project focuses on the optimization of the thrust-to-power ratio in ion propulsion systems, specifically Gridded Ion Thrusters and Hall Effect Thrusters. The study utilizes advanced computational techniques to develop simulation frameworks that enhance the understanding of ion propulsion mechanisms and contribute to more efficient and reliable ion engines for long-duration space missions and interplanetary exploration.

## Key Features
Simulation Models: Developed rough models for Gridded Ion Thrusters and Hall Effect Thrusters.

Optimization: Identified optimal operating parameters to maximize the thrust-to-power ratio.

Validation: Compared simulation results with empirical data from the University of Michigan’s PEPL lab to ensure accuracy.

Visualization: Visualized electromagnetic fields and ion trajectories using Mathematica.

## Project Details
Visualization of Electromagnetic Fields: Created 3D plots to visualize the electromagnetic fields generated by thrusters.

Ion Trajectory Simulation: Simulated ion trajectories to analyze their velocity and acceleration within the thruster.

Parameter Sweeps and Sensitivity Analyses: Conducted extensive analyses to determine the effects of various input variables on engine performance.

## Technologies Used
Mathematica: For simulation and visualization of ion thrusters.

Julia: For comparing simulation results with empirical data from the University of Michigan’s PEPL lab.
